# Embed Me If You Can: A Geometric Perceptron

This repository is the official implementation of the ICCV2021 ["Embed Me If You Can: A Geometric Perceptron"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Melnyk_Embed_Me_if_You_Can_A_Geometric_Perceptron_ICCV_2021_paper.html) paper.

## The proposed MLGP model
 ![Multilayer Geometric Perceptron](misc/mlgp.png)
 


## Requirements
> ðŸ“‹We achieved the original results with Python 3.6.5, ```torch==1.2.0+cu92```, ```scikit-learn==0.19.1```, ```scipy==1.4.1```, ```numpy==1.15.0```, and ```matplotlib==3.0.3```, but we needed to relax the requirements to facilitate the installation.

To install the requirements, run:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Demo

The ```mlgp_demo.ipynb``` notebook demonstrates the training and evaluation of our MLGP model and the analysis and visualization of its hidden units.


## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run the following command:

```
python train.py 
```

> ðŸ“‹Uncomment specific lines in ```train.py``` to use various models described in the paper (default are original hyperparameters). Adjust the ```get_tetris_data```  function arguments accordingly.



## Evaluation

To evaluate one of the trained models on the corresponding test dataset, run:


```
python eval.py
```

> ðŸ“‹ Depending on the choice of a trained model, modify the ```MODEL_PATH``` variable and the ```create_test_set``` function arguments in the ```eval.py``` script (examples are provided).



## Pre-trained models

You can find the pre-trained models in the ```pretrained_models``` folder.



## Results


The performances of the models on the test data and in all experiments are presented in Table 1.

> ðŸ“‹Use ```train.py``` script to train the models with the provided seeds. Use ```eval.py``` to evaluate the models on the corresponding test sets.
