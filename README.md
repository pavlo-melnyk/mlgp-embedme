# Embed Me If You Can: A Geometric PerceptronThis repository is the official implementation of the "Embed Me If You Can: A Geometric Perceptron" paper.## The proposed MLGP model ![Multilayer Geometric Perceptron](misc/mlgp.png) ## Requirements> ðŸ“‹We achieved the original results with Python 3.6.5, ```torch==1.2.0+cu92```, ```scikit-learn==0.19.1```, ```scipy==1.4.1```, ```numpy==1.15.0```, and ```matplotlib==3.0.3```, but we needed to relax the requirements to facilitate the installation.To install the requirements, run:```setuppip install -r requirements.txt```## DemoThe ```mlgp_demo.ipynb``` (```mlgp_demo.html```) notebook demonstrates the training and evaluation of our MLGP model and the analysis and visualization of its hidden units.## TrainingTo train the model(s) in the paper, run the following command:```python train.py ```> ðŸ“‹Uncomment specific lines in ```train.py``` to use various models described in the paper (default are original hyperparameters). Adjust the ```get_tetris_data```  function arguments accordingly.## EvaluationTo evaluate one of the trained models on the corresponding test dataset, run:```python eval.py```> ðŸ“‹ Depending on the choice of a trained model, modify the ```MODEL_PATH``` variable and the ```create_test_set``` function arguments in the ```eval.py``` script (examples are provided).## Pre-trained modelsYou can find the pre-trained models in the ```pretrained_models``` folder.## ResultsThe performances of the models on the test data and in all experiments are presented in Table 1.![Test Accuracies](misc/table_of_results.png)> ðŸ“‹Use ```train.py``` script to train the models with the provided seeds. Use ```eval.py``` to evaluate the models on the corresponding test sets.
